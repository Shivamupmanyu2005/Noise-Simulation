# Noise-Simulation
A React-based interactive simulator visualizing sine waves with adjustable amplitude, noise, and attenuation.   Features a modern UI with glowing effects and smooth animations
 **Interactive Sine Wave Visualization:** Dynamically renders a sine wave on an HTML Canvas.
    8 - **Adjustable Parameters:**
    9     - **Amplitude:** Control the height of the wave.
   10     - **Noise:** Introduce randomness to the wave, simulating interference.
   11     - **Attenuation:** Observe the wave's amplitude decrease over its length.
   12 - **Modern UI/UX:**
   13     - Custom-styled range input sliders with glowing effects.
   14     - Animated text shadow for the title.
   15     - Glowing canvas border and wave line for a futuristic feel.
   16     - Smooth transitions and hover effects powered by `motion/react`.
   17 - **Responsive Design:** (Optional: Add this if you implement responsiveness)
